Those are pages for Xamboo.

You may copy them to your site pages folder, or just call them from your pages library code.

There are 2 ways to use the pages, one is with the user module included directly in the page (highly not recommended since there are no xcontext directly in the pages), and the other is calling the user methods through an APP bridge.

We consider a standard bridge with Setup function to link and call the the bridge.

Then we consider each function of the user and structure are implemented in the APP and linked in the bridge with the same syntax

You should include and call the bridge sub module to include the User in your APP
